  secular:0 "Secular"
  secular_religion_desc:0 "A secular government is one that does not promote any faith in particular.

  atheist:0 "Atheist"

Atheism as a state religion corresponds to a state which is hostile towards -- and actively rooting out -- religious activity of its population, as opposed to secularism, which by contrast is neutral towards religion."
