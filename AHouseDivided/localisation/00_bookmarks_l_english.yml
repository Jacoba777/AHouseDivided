 bookmark_northeast:0 "The Northeastern City-States"
 bookmark_northeast_desc:0 "Moreso than other regions, the northeast has devolved powers down to the smallest constituencies, with nearly every county its own nation. Once the economic backbone of the United States with her many sprawling cities, the Northeast has collapsed under its own weight, and has turned to infighting. In an effort to promote regional peace, a tenuous confederation of states stretching from Northern Virginia to the northenmost suburbs of Boston have formed. Long since separated from the Vatican, Catholics in America have elected a new Pope, housed in Jersey Shore, to provide a sense of continuity in these uncertain times."
 bookmark_midwest:0 "A Fractured Midwest"
 bookmark_midwest_desc:0 "From the shimmering Great Lakes to the fertile Great Plains, the Midwest has survived balkanization to a greater extent than other regions. However, moving east to west, emerging industrial cities like Chicago and Detroit give way to sparsely populated grasslands where organized governments are no longer viable. Kansas City and the surrounding nations are effectively an island of civilization as the lands around them return to tribal societies."
 bookmark_south:0 "Divided Dixieland"
 bookmark_south_desc:0 "The sunny South has exploded into a tapestry of competing powers for southern dominance. Amoung the most powerful is Atlanta, who has consolidated an impressive stretch of northern Georgia, but whose power over its vassal swarm remains contentious. Additionally, a stretch of unadministered land splits the coastal south from the inland south, complicating ambitions to reunite the region. Far to the west in Texas, Houston has become a regional trading hub, making it among the richest nations on the continent."
 bookmark_west:0 "The Tribes of the West"
 bookmark_west_desc:0 "The Wild West, as it is once again called, is isolated from the happenings beyond the mighty Rockies. The cities and towns near the Pacific coast have largely retained their governing authority, whereas the intermountain region has primarily returned to collections of nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes. Among the most powerful of these tribes is Denver, who is well-poised to unite the peoples of the Front Range."
 bookmark_linear_dev:0 "Alternative Start: Linear Dev"
 bookmark_linear_dev_desc:0 "This scenario is the same as the previous four, but development is scaled linearly rather than logarithmically. This creates provinces with extremely high development around cities (LA county is over 900 dev), and most provinces are 3 development, creating very unbalanced gameplay."
 bookmark_fifty_states:0 "Alternative Start: 50 States"
 bookmark_fifty_states_desc:0 "(Note: This scenario uses the linear dev scale. Read the bookmark description for Linear Dev for more information.). With the Federal Goverment dissolved, the fifty states have found themselves all on their own. Inter-state tensions remain high, and war seems inevitable. Can the people of the United States be brought together under one nation once more?"
